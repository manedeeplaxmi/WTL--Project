<p><pre><h1>The DIY Approach for Nutrition</h1><br><br>

<h3>Most net savvy folks scour the net for hours to identify the best possible diet to suit their taste buds. The internet is a treasure trove of ‘data’, but requires diligence to sift and sort the information that suits you best. Many people do manage to find the right diet for themselves and achieve their weight loss goals. Kudos to them and their resolve.
However a vast majority end up either giving up, being overwhelmed by the density of information, or just being unable to sustain the aggressive diet plans. Let’s just face it, the Atkins diet is not for everybody.
Recently several apps have been launched in the market providing guidance at your fingertips, but again, the relevance to the Indian context remains a big gap. We may be a single country, but our cuisines are so varied, that getting the right diet for your home is a big challenge.
Another problem posed by DIY diets is the great Indian festival and family function juggernaut. Three weeks of dieting efforts could just go down the drain due to a Diwali or a cousin’s wedding.
Managing the various phases of weight loss can be a bit tricky as well since your taste buds need change and additionally your body nutritional needs change once you have lost a certain amount of weight. People going on their own tend to lose steam if the same foods stop having the necessary impact or the taste buds can no longer take it.

Professionally Guided Nutrition Management

A new trend in India is the adoption of nutrition counselling to manage weight loss. This trend was initiated by large weight loss chains. Increasingly people are seeking professional advice to manage their weight. Benefits of such a long term programs include:
Tailoring diet plans to suit one’s taste buds (matching diet cuisine to home cooking habits)

Getting advice to manage various ‘stages of weight loss’ – changing the diet to make it more palatable and meet changing nutritional requirements

Adjusting diet to support medical or lifestyle requirements such as Diabetes, PCOS, lactose intolerance, veganism etc.

Receiving tips to manage ‘carb overdose’ at festivals and functions

Advice to get back on track after the weekend binge at a party (it can’t be avoided, can it!)

Periodic health coaching to help maintain focus and motivate you to achieve goals

Monitoring weight daily and receiving regular feedback (After all, what gets measured, gets done!)

Several people have strong positive feedback to this approach. ‘I lost 4 kilos in a month by just actively managing my diet supported by my dietician. I did not know it was that easy.’ says Sonali from Delhi. ‘I have always been on and off diets for 3 years now, since I chose the most aggressive diet and never managed to sustain it. Thanks to my dietician, I was able to eat well enough and lose weight at the same time’ says Priya from Bangalore. Vinod from Chennai has another view – ‘The constant motivation and the continuous weight monitoring with feedback ensured I achieve my goals. Without support I don’t think this would have been possible beyond a certain threshold’
While professional dietician counselling is considered normal in the west, it is slowly becoming acceptable for people in India. The obesity epidemic, sedentary lifestyles, and increasing trend of junk food and eating out are ensuring that nutritionists are here to stay.

A New Approach to Nutrition Counselling

Dieticians typically start counselling by gathering detailed information about each individual. They then develop an initial diet plan and review on a weekly basis. Adjustments are then made based on changing needs, upcoming events, changing preferences etc.
Given that physical presence is not required for nutrition counselling, nutritionists are now using several tools such as Skype, WhatsApp etc. to be “digitally close” to their clients and support them through the process. The adoption of technology provides convenience and most importantly, real time access to nutrition guidance, improving outcomes. Ms. Gandhi, a renowned nutritionist, speaks, “I have several clients from Australia, US and Middle East. They just love the fact that distances no longer matter”. The founder of a leading nutrition chain says “We have customers from all over India, several people prefer dieticians with understanding of their local food. It becomes more important with the floating population.” According to another dietician Priya “The key is the ability to monitor weight on a daily basis, and technology allow nutritionists to stay connected with clients about their weight loss and drive compliance”
For those looking to lose weight – going digital might just be the convenient new option.</h3>
