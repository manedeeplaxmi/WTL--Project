<p><pre><h1>Why regular health checkups are important?</h1>



India is a country of the young. 65% of the country’s population is below the age of 35 years. However, we are also the world's capital of coronary heart disease and diabetes. More than 70 per cent of middle aged Indians will suffer with non-insulin dependent diabetes during their lifetime. According to recent data, approximately 30% of the urban population and 15% percent of the population living in rural areas suffer from high blood pressure and heart attacks, with 24 lac deaths in India due to heart disease every year.

Reports from leading research institutes in India and around the globe suggest that Type 2 Diabetes which is a more commonly occurring form of diabetes has a strong link to family history and lineage. Similarly there is an increased risk of heart attack if an immediate family member has had an attack before the age of 45 years in case of men and 55 years in case of women. Moreover, in the case of stroke, it is believed that inheriting hypertension is a key factor.

Increased blood glucose (diabetes) and increased blood pressure account to close to 30% of risks associated with deaths due to non-communicable diseases in India. These risks have a strong link to family history and India being the world’s capital for such conditions, implies that the young population of India is at risk.

To add to the worry is the rapidly changing lifestyle and habits of the Indian population. Apart from family history, stress is the number one lifestyle risk factor, ranking above physical inactivity and obesity, according to global professional services company Towers Watson.
Since, the cause of the major diseases is a combination of family and environmental factors, individuals must make themselves aware about the risks, keep a track of the vital health parameters and manage their lifestyle accordingly.

As per Public Health Foundation of India nearly 52% of Indians are not aware that they have high blood sugar. In this age of technology and access it is criminal not to be aware of your own health. This is why regular health tests are essential especially for individuals who are above 30 years of age and have a family member who has a history of any of the common non-communicable diseases.
