<h1 align="center">VITAMIN D TEST</h1>

<h2>How is it used?</h2>
<p class="intro">
A vitamin D test is used to:<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Determine if bone weakness, bone malformation, or abnormal metabolism of calcium (reflected by abnormal calcium, phosphorus, PTH) is occurring as a result of a deficiency or excess of vitamin D</li>
  <li>Help diagnose or monitor problems with parathyroid gland functioning since PTH is essential for vitamin D activation</li>
  <li>Screen people who are at high risk of deficiency, as recommended by the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Institute of Medicine, and the Endocrine Society</li>

  <li>Help monitor the health status of individuals with diseases that interfere with fat absorption, such as cystic fibrosis and Crohn disease, since vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin and is absorbed from the intestine like a fat</li>
  <li>Monitor people who have had gastric bypass surgery and may not be able to absorb enough vitamin D</li>
  <li>Help determine the effectiveness of treatment when vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and/or magnesium supplementation is prescribed</li>
  
</ul>

<h2>When is it ordered?</h2>
<p class="intro">
25-hydroxyvitamin D<br>
When calcium is low and/or a person has symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, such as bone malformation in children (rickets) and bone weakness, softness, or fracture in adults (osteomalacia), 25-hydroxyvitamin D usually is ordered to identify a possible deficiency in vitamin D.<br>

The test may be requested when an individual is known to be at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Older adults, people who are institutionalized or homebound and/or have limited sun exposure, those who are obese, who have undergone gastric bypass surgery, and/or who have fat malabsorption are at an increased risk of a vitamin D deficiency. Also included in this group are people with darker skin and breastfed infants.
<br>

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<br>
This testing may be ordered when kidney disease or abnormalities of the enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is suspected. Rarely, this test may be done when calcium is high or a person has a disease that might produce excess amounts of vitamin D, such as sarcoidosis or some forms of lymphoma (because immune cells may make 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).
<br>

<h2>What does the test result mean?</h2>
<p class="intro">
<br>
Although there are differences among vitamin D methods, most laboratories utilize similar reference intervals. Because toxicity is rare, the focus has been on the lower limit and what cut-off for total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (D2 + D3) indicates deficiency.<br>


<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>The Endocrine Society defines vitamin D deficiency as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood level below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/liter) and vitamin D insufficiency as a level between 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/liter).</li>
  <li>The U.S. Institute of Medicine has concluded that a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/liter) or above is adequate for bone health, and that levels greater than 30 ng/mL do not offer significantly better effects. However, it is fair to say that the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D associated with protection from the many other disorders recently associated with a lack of vitamin D is controversial.</li>
  
  
</ul>

<br>25-hydroxyvitamin D<br>
A low blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D may mean that a person is not getting enough exposure to sunlight or enough dietary vitamin D to meet his or her body's demand or that there is a problem with its absorption from the intestines. Occasionally, drugs used to treat seizures, particularly phenytoin (Dilantin), can interfere with the production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the liver.

<br>

There is some evidence that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of some cancers, immune diseases, and cardiovascular disease.
