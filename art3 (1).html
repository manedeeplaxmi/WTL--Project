<p><pre><h1> The Burden of Mental Health in India</h1>


<h3>The burden of mental health is immense with 1 in 5 adults globally experiencing a mental health condition every year. 1 in 20 live with a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In addition to the person directly experiencing a mental illness, family, friends and communities are also affected.

WHO predicts that 20% of India's population will suffer from some form of mental illness by the year 2020, posing a huge economic burden on the country.

According to some studies, 50% of mental health conditions begin by age 14 and 75% of mental health conditions develop by age 24. The normal personality and behaviour changes of adolescence may mimic or mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Early engagement and support are crucial to improving outcomes and increasing the promise of recovery.



The Problem of Awareness and Acceptance

In India the biggest concern is that most people do not seek help for their mental health condition. Those who feel troubled, depressed or anxious typically think several times before accessing any kind of help or counselling.

People use words like 'mad', 'asylum', carelessly. The term mental illness has been sold very poorly - people are labelled crazy, screwed up, mad, bonkers, etc. if they seek help. The connotation is so negative when you say you need help, that, people are ashamed to admit it to themselves or their families that they are not in a good place.

Going to the 'psychiatrist' is reserved for crazy people, and the general impression is that if someone is feeling sad and lonely, they just need to be around friends. However we have seen a rise in India's suicide rate. Of these, 68 per cent of these were between the age of 15 and 29, surrounded by family and friends. So clearly not all lonely people can be cheered up by being with other people. In fact feeling lonely in a crowd is a very common emotion experienced by most people. It is the inability to speak about these emotions that often leads people to commit suicide.

Typically people in our country view mental health issues as a personal defect and not as a disease which needs to be treated. This attitude needs to change. In fact the National Mental Health Policy has alluded to changing this negative mindset as a priority.

Former Health Minister Dr. HarshVardhan, while working on the National Mental Health Policy, said there has been considerable progress in treatment methods for mental patients and their recovery rates have improved. Unfortunately, society still stigmatises those who suffer from routine psychiatric problems and so their treatment is either delayed or denied. We need to build up a social movement to change mindsets and focus on the human dimension of mental illnesses.



Treatment Options

An anxiety-ridden or a depressed patient, is usually given tips like, 'snap out of it', 'go for a movie and you will be fine', or 'just cheer up', without realising that these are diseases and they need treatment from qualified specialists.

Many people are still unaware that there are effective treatments for many mental disorders. For example, nearly 50-60% of persons with depression will recover with treatment in three to eight months; with schizophrenia, a combination of regular medication, family education and support can reduce the relapse rate from 50% to 10%.

For people of all ages, early detection, assessment, and linkage with treatment and supports can prevent mental health problems from compounding and poor life outcomes from accumulating. Early intervention can have a significant impact on the lives of children and adults who experience mental health problems.

Emerging research indicates that intervening early can interrupt the negative course of some mental illnesses and may, in some cases, lessen long-term disability. New understanding of the brain indicates that early identification and intervention can sharply improve outcomes and that longer periods of abnormal thoughts and behaviour have cumulative effects and can limit capacity for recovery.

Psychologist Varkha Chulani says, "Treatment of a mental illness depends on why it has occurred. Is it chemically caused? Or is it attitudinally caused? If it's chemical, medication is required and if need be ECTs too. And if it's attitudinal, then intensive psychotherapy is needed."



Access to Care a Huge Concern

There is also a paucity of mental health professionals in the country. India has 0.4 psychiatrists, 0.04 psychiatric nurses, 0.02 psychologists and 0.02 social workers per 100,000 population. This is significantly lower than the standards stipulated by international health agencies such as WHO.

Additionally, India has a skewed distribution of mental health professionals, with nearly 10 times as many psychiatrists as psychiatric nurses, and nearly 20 times as many psychiatrists as psychologists and social workers. In most countries the ratios are the reverse, with 10-15 times as many psychologists, psychiatric nurses and social workers as psychiatrists.

The situation is compounded with most specialists operating out of Tier 1 cities such as Bangalore, Delhi etc., limiting access to smaller cities and towns. People in smaller cities end up using services of babas and quacks with the hope that the evil curse can be lifted, when they should be seeking professional care.

The government has not done much to date, with less than 1% of India's health budget being spent on mental health. The new Mental Health Policy should change the situation, but it would take several years to see the impact of these interventions.

Why is Mental Health Important?

Mental health is extremely important. Mental health is about being able, fit and in balance and it is not about being crazy. As one psychologist said, only fat people do not visit gyms, rather, people who wish to stay fit, do. If I want to be healthier, I diet and eat well. Similarly, if I want to be alert, cope with challenges of life, get along easily with people, I should seek professional help.

People should start accepting that they need professional help and start seeking counselling/ care to ensure positive life outcomes.



Innovations in Care

As traditional care delivery models continue to build on existing infrastructure, emerging models such as online video based tele-psychiatry and tele-psychology are picking up. These services provide an easy way to access care from highly trained professionals from the privacy and convenience of one's home, no matter where you are. This is a great way to seek early assessments and interventions, get second opinion or even seek behavioural therapy to facilitate emotional well-being.
