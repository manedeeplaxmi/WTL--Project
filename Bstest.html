<h2>How is it used?</h2>
<p class="intro">
The blood glucose test may be used to:<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Detect high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) and low blood glucose (hypoglycemia)</li>
  <li>Screen for diabetes in people who are at risk before signs and symptoms are apparent; in some cases, there may be no early signs or symptoms of diabetes. Screening can therefore be useful in helping to identify it and allowing for treatment before the condition worsens or complications arise.</li>
  <li>Help diagnose diabetes, prediabetes and gestational diabetes</li>
  <li>Monitor glucose levels in people diagnosed with diabetes</li>
  
  
</ul>

<br>

A few different testing protocols may be used to evaluate blood glucose levels, depending on the purpose.

<br>

Screening and Diagnosis<br>
The following tests may be used for screening and diagnosis of type 1, type 2 or prediabetes. (Gestational diabetes testing is different—see below.) If the initial screening result from one of the tests is abnormal, the test is repeated on another day. The repeat result must also be abnormal to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
 <li>Fasting glucose (fasting blood glucose, FBG) – this test measures the level of glucose in the blood after fasting for at least 8 hours.</li>
 <li>2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) – for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done (see above), then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink. Another blood sample is drawn 2 hours after the glucose drink. This protocol "challenges" the person's body to process the glucose. Normally, the blood glucose level rises after the drink and stimulates the pancreas to release insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin allows the glucose to be taken up by cells. As time passes, the blood glucose level is expected to decrease again. When a person is unable to produce enough insulin, or if the body's cells are resistant to its effects (insulin resistance), then less glucose is transported from the blood into cells and the blood glucose level remains high.</li>
 <li>A different test called hemoglobin A1c may be used as an alternative to glucose testing for screening and diagnosis. (For more, see the article on A1c.).</li>
 
 
 </ul>

 <br>
 Sometimes a blood sample may be drawn and glucose measured when a person has not been fasting, for example, when a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is performed. If the result is abnormal, it is typically followed up with a fasting blood glucose test or a GTT.<br>

Glucose blood tests are also used to screen pregnant women for gestational diabetes between their 24th and 28th week of pregnancy. The American Diabetes Association and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend that pregnant women not previously known to have diabetes be screened and diagnosed, using either a one-step or two-step approach. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the two-step approach.<br>

<h2>When is it ordered?</h2>
<p class="intro">
Several health organizations, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), recommend diabetes screening when a person is age 45 or older or when a person of any age has risk factors. Examples of risk factors include:<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">


<li>Overweight, obese, or physically inactive</li>
<li>A close (first degree) relative with diabetes</li>
<li>A woman who delivered a baby weighing more than 9 pounds or with a history of gestational diabetes</li>
<li>A woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome</li>
<li>High-risk race or ethnicity such as African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander
<li>High blood pressure (hypertension) or taking medication for high blood pressure</li>
<li>Low HDL cholesterol level (less than 35 mg/dL or 0.90 mmol/L) and/or a high triglyceride level (more than 250 mg/dL or 2.82 mmol/L)</li>
<li>A1c equal to or above 5.7%</li>
<li>Prediabetes identified by previous testing</li>
<li>History of cardiovascular disease (CVD)</li>
</ul>
